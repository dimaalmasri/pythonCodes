This file contains some examples for built-in functions in python
they are functions that do certain things 
I will explain

#example 1 = .upper()
#added by @basmalakamal
str1 = "hello world"
print str1.upper()
#this how we use it and it is used to return the string with capital letters

#example 2 = isupper()
#added by @basmalakamal
str2 = "I love coding"
print str2.isupper()
#this function returns a boolean it is used to see if all letters in the string are capital I have only one capital letter here 
#so it returned False
#lets try again here
str3 = "PYTHON IS AWESOME"
print str3.isupper() #prints True

#example 3 = lower()
#added by @basmalakamal
str4 = "BASMALAH"
print str4.lower()
#it returns the string with small letters

#example 4 = islower()
#added by @basmalakamal
str5 = "Python"
print str5.islower()
#this function returns a boolean it is used to see if all letters in the string are small I have one capital letter here 
#so it returned False
#lets try again here
str6 = "python"
print str6.islower() #prints True

#example 5  = float()
#added by @basmalakamal
print float('12\n')
#we can use this one to input an integer and it will return a float depends on what you have written 
#for example I wrote 12\n (\n means a space) so it returned 12.0


#example 6 = id()
#added by @basmalakamal
print id(str6)
#it returns the identity of any object cause every object has an identity in python memory

#example 7 = len()
#added by @basmalakamal





#example 8 = int()
#added by @basmalakamal



#example 9 = str()
#added by @basmalakamal




#example 10 = max()
#added by @basmalakamal



#example 11 = sort()
#added by @basmalakamal


#example 12 = replace()
#added by @basmalakamal


#example 13 = append()
#added by @basmalakamal

#example 14 = index()
#added by @basmalakamal

#example 15 = split()
#added by @basmalakamal

#example 16 = join()
